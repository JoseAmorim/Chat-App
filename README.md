### Tech

Chat App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React-Native] - combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Socket.io] - real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
 
### Installation

Node Chat requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Chat-App
$ yarn
$ yarn ios or yarn android
```
